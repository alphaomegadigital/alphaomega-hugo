[Termite Catchers](https://termitecatchers.com.au/) is a pest control company based in Melbourne, that specialises in the eradication, treatment and management of termites amongst residential and commercial properties. They needed a website that communicated their company goals and values, whilst also educating prospective clients about pest control services and what methods they employ as termite specialists.

The project had been started by a web designer, who could not finish the build, so I took over and finished the pages, fixed broken links, added a contact form, email integration, and setup a branded email responder template in [Active Campaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/).

Itâ€™s always great when a client provides detailed written content, as google loves 2000+ word pages. I loved working with termite Catchers on this project, and we have an ongoing relationship building other web projects for their business as well as management of [email marketing](https://www.activecampaign.com/) and Google [adwords](https://ads.google.com/). You can view their completed site [here](https://termitecatchers.com.au/).
