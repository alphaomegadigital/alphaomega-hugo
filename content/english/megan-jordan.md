Megan originally designed her own website, using a non code page builder that promised the world and left her short on many functions. Although she did an excellent job on the design, she was unable to write blog posts, was limited to strictly 5 pages and as a non programmer, was limited in her capacity to build in SEO to the html tags such as title, meta, header, canonical, image alt and anchor tags. 

Megans goal was to have a similar aesthetic to her previous website, but with all the functionality that WordPress offers. Working together, we achieved that in about 8 weeks and she now has a optimised, SEO friendly WordPress website that is already performing better than her previous site. Her previous site was generating about 1 lead per month, and within the first week of deploying her new site Megan has received 3 leads which is a tenfold increase for her Celebrant business. 

Here is the final result of Meganâ€™s web project, which you can also view [here](https://meganjordan.com.au/).
