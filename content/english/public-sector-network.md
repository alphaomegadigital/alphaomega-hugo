Public Sector Network is a peer to peer social learning platform for government. They excel at running industry leading events, and have up to 40,000 government professionals attending events in person or online. I spend half of my week working as the web development lead for Public Sector Network.

Their website was built by an agency, but I am solely responsible for maintenance of the PSN site including: managing the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Server, updating the WordPress plugins and software, managing the SQL database, optimising page tags for SEO, CSS/JS changes and debugging. My role also encompasses many other WordPress development tasks such as modifying custom post types, working with advanced custom fields, building template files and also managing the [Woo-commerce](https://woocommerce.com/) and [learn-dash](https://www.learndash.com/) payment gateways.

Our next goal is to maintain the sites functionality whilst rebuilding the site with minimal plugins. Together, we aim to improve user experience and build in better SEO structure into the tags, images, meta and schema.
