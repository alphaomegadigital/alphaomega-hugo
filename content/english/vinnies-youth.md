When Vinnie’s Victoria reached out for help building a wordpress website for their Melbourne Youth team, I was happy to oblige. There’s nothing more satisfying than working with a client whose values so strongly align with your own. Vinnie’s are Australia’s premier charity, and work tirelessly to fight homelessness and raise funds for those living in poverty.

For their youth website, Vinnie’s wanted an aesthetic that was similar to their sister micro-sites in [NSW](https://youthnsw.vinnies.org.au/) and [QLD](https://qld.vinnies.org.au/), but that displayed and encourage participation in their youth Victoria programs. I usually work with Gutenberg, but Vinnie’s requested Wp bakery page builder in this case as the marketing team wanted the ability to create and update pages, add media and blog posts and Wp Bakery was a front end builder they were most familiar with.

The site had to be on brand, yet easy to locate require resources and navigate. Customised contact forms were built targeting the different programs, that also filter to different Vinnie’s staff so assist in the management and booking of school functions.

The youth team at Vinnie’s Melbourne were booking programs and managing the admin of school functions manually, whcih was time consuming. They now have a website and booking system that automates their booking requests, stores client information, allows for invoicing, session allocation and locked down content for members of their site to access.
