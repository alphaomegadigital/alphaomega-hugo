Elissa Hill is a communications specialist, and she wanted to make sure her website reflected her style guide and brand values. Elissa had a full site UX audit provided by an agency, and they provided me with a document to ensure all elements reflected her new style guide.

I love working on projects where clients provide design briefs and specifications like this, as they know what they want to achieve and have a clear focus on getting the job done.

The overall look and feel of the site needed a refresh, so based on the brief, I updated the fonts, layout, links, page structure and icons. Her website now reflects her new brand identity, and has an improved navigation structure with optimised pages.

Here is the final result of this website upgrade project, which you can view [here](https://elissahill.com.au/).
